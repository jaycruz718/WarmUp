### Working with Obejcts and Loops!!!

//âœ… Goal 1: Loop through the following array and calculate the total score.
//âœ… Follow Up: Print your result to the console using string interpolation for clarity.

const games = [
  { name: "Game 1", score: 5 },
  { name: "Game 2", score: 8 },
  { name: "Game 3", score: 2 },
  { name: "Game 4", score: 10 },
];

let totalScore = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i++) {
  totalScore += games[i].score;
}

console.log(`Total Score is ${totalScore}`);

## âœ… Goal 2: Create another loop that only calculates total of scores greater than 5
//âœ… Follow Up: Print your result to the console using string interpolation for clarity.
let scoreOver5 = 0;
games.forEach((game) => {

  if (game.score > 5) {
    scoreOver5 += game.score;
  }

});

console.log(`Total of scores over 5: ${scoreOver5}`)

## âœ… Goal 3: Find the game with the highest score.
//âœ… Follow Up: Print your result to the console using string interpolation for clarity.

let topGame;
let highScore = 0;

for(let game of games){
    if (game.score > highScore){
        highScore = game.score;
        topGame = game.name;
    }
}

console.log(`${topGame} has the highest score of ${highScore}`);

## ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Bonus: Print out EACH game that scored above 'average'
